# Twin Cities Aid Distribution Locations
A webapp to coordinate aid and care in the Twin Cities. https://twin-cities-mutual-aid.org/

## About the project
This project is only a few weeks old, and things are changing very rapidly. We'll do our best to keep this readme up-to-date, but if something doesn't look right, it's probably out of date.

This project is unusual because there are two separate teams working in tandem:

* **Website team**: This team (us) is using a channel within the Open Twin Cities slack to communicate. There's a link at the top of the [Open Twin Cities](https://www.opentwincities.org) website to join, if you'd like to help out.
* **[Twin Cities Mutual Aid Project](http://www.tcmap.org)**: TCMAP is a collective, all-volunteeer effort that works to coordinate with aid sites and manage the data that feeds the site on a day-to-day basis. Over 100 volunteers have now been involved in the project. Leadership and tech-oriented volunteers from TCMAP coordinate with stakeholders to source designs, product direction, feature requests and feedback that drive development. TCMAP spawned from a large Facebook group called [South Minneapolis Mutual Aid Autonomous Zone Coordination](https://www.facebook.com/groups/southsidemutualaid) that emerged in the wake of the uprisings in Minneapolis in May 2020. 

**Participation is welcome both on the web team and TCMAP sides of this project**. Some developers have engaged through Github and the Open Twin Cities Slack channel alone; others have joined TCMAP to help coordinate efforts, or just to better understand use cases. You can join TCMAP through the [volunteer page on their website](http://www.tcmap.org/volunteer). 

## Feature requests & feedback
We're using [Github Issues](https://github.com/Twin-Cities-Mutual-Aid/twin-cities-aid-distribution-locations/issues) to manage tasks, and have a [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/Twin-Cities-Mutual-Aid/projects/1) set up. If you'd like access to the kanban board reach out in the [OTC slack channel](https://otc-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

If you've got a feature request or feedback to share on the website, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Twin-Cities-Mutual-Aid/twin-cities-aid-distribution-locations/issues/new) on GH issues, or bring it up in slack.

## Data

Data is sourced from a google spreadsheet.
* Example spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETV6xakGCkp3dmgfpayjEBQii8p_ElMXYuDut3EDZTE/edit#gid=0
* Google Apps Script utility script also available to automatically update a row timestamp and insert latitude and longitude when an address cell is added or updated: https://github.com/mc-funk/community-map-google-scripts/

To test locally with your own copy of the spreadsheet, duplicate the example
spreadsheet, make your changes, and re-publish it. Then follow the steps
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-google-sheets-as-json-endpoint to
extract the sheet ID out of the url to plug into the DATA_URL const.

## About the application
This started as a very lightweight, single page html file, and we've tried very hard to keep things as simple as possible.

### Setup
1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/) at the version specified in the [`.node-version`](.node-version) file. If you use a version manager like [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this should be detected automatically.
2. Install dependencies with npm
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure [environment variables](#environment-variables)
4. Build and run the application with npm
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Visit the application in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
6. Start building!


### Environment Variables
The application uses [environmental variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) to manage configuration between environments. These values are set in a `.env` file in the project root directory. 

To set up a `.env`, copy the `.env.example` file, which lists needed configuration values. For example, in the Mac OS terminal:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

A set variable in the `.env` file will look like this:
```
SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_MAPBOXGL_ACCESS_TOKEN=1234
```

If you're a member of the Twin Cities Mutual Aid organization you can find the default values for the local development `env` file here:

https://github.com/Twin-Cities-Mutual-Aid/secrets/blob/master/.env


If not, you can ask for the most recent values of the configuration values from the Open Twin Cities slack `#tc-aid-dev` channel. They are pinned in the channel.

If you need to introduce a new environmental variable, please coordinate with developers in the `#tc-aid-dev` channel, add it to the `.env.example` file, and note it in your pull request.

### Run locally

To run a development server that will auto-reload on save, run this command from the project directory:

```
npm run dev
```

A server will run on http://localhost:8080

## Adding things

### Adding A Dependency

1. Add your dependency with `npm install --save <dep>`
2. Use your dependency with `import <whatever> from '<dep>'`
3. Run `npm run snowpack install` to vendor the dependency

### Adding Stylesheets

#### From a dependency

1. Import the sheet from the dist folder like `import '<dep>/dist/stylesheet.css`
2. That's it.

#### From a new Source file

1. Create a stylesheet in `src/styles`
2. Import the sheet either in the index or from whatever js file the styles apply to.

### Adding an Image

Images go in `public/images` and will be served under `<url>/images/image_name.whatever`

### Any other static file

If you need to add some other kind of static file, it should go somewhere in the public folder.
