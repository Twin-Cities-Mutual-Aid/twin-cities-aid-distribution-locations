# Code of Conduct

The Twin Cities Aid Map community welcomes participation from everyone. 

## Expectations 

Our community expects that participants:

* Create a community where members are safe, respected, friendly, and free to fully express their identities
* Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination and harassment
* Take responsibility for their words and actions
* Value everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions
* Encourage participation, questions, and discussion
* Don’t assume everyone has the same context 
* Find ways for people to productively contribute their time and skills (technical or not) 
* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process
* Ensure our local community is well-represented in the design and implementation of projects. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
* Respect our local community partners and ensure relationships with them remain participatory and productive

Our community members organize with resources of [Open Twin Cities](https://www.opentwincities.org/), so are obliged to abide by that organization's similar [code of conduct](https://www.opentwincities.org/about/#code-of-conduct).
