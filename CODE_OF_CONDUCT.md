# Code of Conduct

The Twin Cities Mutual Aid Map community welcomes participation from everyone. 

## Expectations 

Our community expects that participants:

* Create a community where members are safe, respected, friendly, and free to fully express their identities
* Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination and harassment
* Take responsibility for their words and actions
* Value everyone’s ideas and find ways for people to productively contribute their time and skills
* Encourage participation, questions, and discussion
* Don’t assume everyone has the same context 
* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process
* Ensure our local community is well-represented in the design and implementation of projects. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
* Respect our local community partners and ensure relationships with them remain participatory and productive

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the community.

Our community members organize with resources of [Open Twin Cities](https://www.opentwincities.org/), so are obliged to abide by that organization's similar [code of conduct](https://www.opentwincities.org/about/#code-of-conduct).
