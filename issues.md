## Issues

### Preexisting Issues
- [ ] Running `snowpack` yields a bunch of new package updates, including some that haven't been built
- [ ] ESLint issues (ignoring style for now)
- [ ] Node version is out of date
- [ ] Get rid of Moment.js, lodash

### New Issues (i.e. as a result of my changes)
- [x] Figure out how to re-render active popup with correct language if language changes
    - Update: Re-rendered entire map when language changes... feels clunkier than before, but it's a very specific use-case I guess?
    - Another update: I broke this lol not sure how :sob:
    - Yet **another** update: I figured out a solution that both adheres to the React Rules of Hooksâ„¢ and also doesn't do a full map reload! ðŸŽ‰ I just had to separate the hooks that initialized the map and the hook that sets the active popup's HTML content.
- [x] Figure out how to umount popup component from DOM when unselected
    - Update: just rendered popup as static markup rather than React DOM component... not ideal but whatever
- [x] Figure out this weird error, which happens every time I click from one item to another in the location list
    - It might be that the popup objects are being modified/removed improperly?
    - Update: figured it out! I had to move the `activeLocation` state to the top-level main component, and refactor the `closePopup()` logic.

Warning: Cannot update a component (`Mapbox`) while rendering a different component (`Main`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `Main`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render

```
- [ ] Figure out why switching languages doesn't switch language of active popup in certain situations... still need to figure out concrete reproduction steps on this one

### TODO:
- [x] Add the react hooks ESLint config
- [ ] Make sure the popup content is identical to production (currently missing Currently Open For Distributing/Receiving)
- [ ] Filters/search logic
- [ ] Migrate off of `moment`, re-implement "Last Updated At" and datetime parsing
    - Maybe [timeago](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timeago.js) for "Last Updated At"?
- [ ] Re-enable all the ESLint issues I disabled
